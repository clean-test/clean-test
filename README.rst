A modern C++-20 unit-testing framework for professionals.

==========
Motivation
==========

Many great unit-testing frameworks have been released so far.
Yet none combines the following qualities:

* **Macro free**:
  expression introspection without macros,
  leverages modern C++-20,
  easy to discover.

* **Fully parallel**:
  execute tests on all CPU cores,
  safely observe any parallel failures.

* **Production ready**:
  easy to integrate as CMake library without dependencies,
  JUnit reports for CI,
  full UTF-8 support,
  flexible runtime configuration.
